#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is an engineering branch associated with development of software product using well-defined scientific principles, methods and procedures. Software engineering plays an importance role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The history of software engineering goes way back to the 1940s and 1950s. Key milestones include the development of programming languages such as Fortran and C, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, the rise of object-oriented programming in 1980s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of Software Development Life Cycle includes,
1. Requirements- It gathers and document the user's needs and system requirements to ensure the software meets business goals.
2. Design- It creates a high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture, including database design, UI/UX and blueprints for development.
3. Implementation- Developers write code and build software following best practices and programming standards.
4. Testing- It ensures the software is bug-free, and secure by performing unit, integration and system testing.
5. Deployment- Releases the software to the users, either in a testing or staging environment.
6. Maintenance- Provides ongoing support, and updates based on the user feedback to the software up to date

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

In Approach; Waterfall is Sequential and linear whilst Agile is Iterative and flexible.

In Phases; Waterfall, each phase such as, planning, design, development, testing and eployment are completed before moving to the next whereas Agile work is divided into small increments (sprints) with continuous feedback.

For Flexibility; Waterfall are rigid, that is, their changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed whilst Agile is highly adaptable to changes throughout development.

In Documentation; Waterfall has extensive documentation before development whilst Agile has minimal documentation, more focus on working software
		
Some examples of scenarios includes,
Waterfall is Suitable for:
Large-scale projects with fixed requirements – Example: Government or military software development.
Safety-critical systems – Example: Medical software or aviation control systems, where thorough documentation and testing are mandatory.
Projects with strict regulatory compliance – Example: Financial software requiring detailed audit trails.

Agile is Suitable for:
Startups and rapidly evolving projects – Example: A mobile app startup experimenting with new features.
Software with frequent updates – Example: E-commerce platforms like Amazon, which require constant improvements.
Customer-driven applications – Example: SaaS (Software as a Service) products that need regular enhancements based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality 
Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer (Software Engineer)- They are responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software solutions. They write, test, and maintain clean, efficient, and scalable code. They also collaborate with other developers and stakeholders to define software requirements.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer- They ensure software quality by identifying bugs, testing functionality, and verifying performance before release. They develop and execute test cases, test plans, and automated test scripts. They identify, document, and track software bugs and defects.

Project Manager (PM)- They oversee the entire software development lifecycle, ensuring timely delivery, resource management, and stakeholder communication. They define project scope, goals, and deliverables. They create and manage project timelines, budgets, and resources. They also coordinate between developers, designers, QA engineers, and clients.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for writing, debugging, and testing code. It features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools speed up coding. IDEs help manage large projects with tools for searching and refactoring code. IDEs support plugins for version control, deployment, and testing frameworks. Some examples are Visual studio code and PyCharm.

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps developers track changes to code, collaborate with team members, and maintain a history of modifications. It helps multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously using branches. Also, it maintains a history of modifications, making it easy to revert to previous versions. Some examples are Git and Apache Subversion (SVN).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging Complex Issues- Identifying and fixing bugs in large and complex codebases can be time-consuming.
Strategy:
Use debugging tools like breakpoints, loggers, and profilers.
Follow structured debugging techniques, such as binary search debugging.
Write unit tests to catch bugs early.

2. Managing Tight Deadlines- Developers often work under pressure to deliver projects within strict deadlines.
Strategy:
Use Agile methodologies to break work into smaller, manageable sprints.
Prioritize tasks with Kanban boards or task management tools like Jira or Trello.
Avoid burnout by practicing good time management and setting realistic goals.

3. Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technologies- The tech industry evolves quickly, and staying updated can be overwhelming.
Strategy:
Follow online courses, blogs, and tech forums such as Coursera, Medium, Stack Overflow.
Join developer communities and participate in open-source projects.
Set aside time for continuous learning and experimentation with new tools.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing- It is a type of testing that tests individual components such as functions, methods or classes in insolation. It is performed by developers using testing frameworks. It verifies code correctness at the smallest level.

Integration Testing- It is a type of testing that tests the interactions between multiple units or modules to verify they work together. It detects issues like API mismatches. It ensures modules work together.

System Testing- It is a type of testing that tests the entire application as a complete system to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements.  It validates overall application behavior.

Acceptance Testing- It is a type of testing that confirms whether the software meets business requirements and user expectations. It confirms user satisfaction before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, such as, ChatGPT to generate the most relevant and accurate responses. It is all about crafting questions or statements to maximize the AI’s ability to understand and deliver precise, useful results. It enhances accurate responses, customize and control of the AI’s behavior for different tasks and expands its capabilities.  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a vague prompt- Tell me about technology

Improved version- Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming the gaming industry, focusing on better user experience and thriller.
